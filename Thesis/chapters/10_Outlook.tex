\chapter{Outlook}
In summary, the goal of this thesis was to gather a selection of optimization methods specifically tailored to \gls{VR}. Of these methods, a subset was to be implemented in an industrial real-time visualization rendering engine. Finally, these implementations were to be benchmarked in a high stress scenario to asses the performance of each optimization by itself and in conjunction with the remaining methods. This goal sprung from the hope to collect useful information and tangible numbers about ways to speed up \gls{VR} rendering by a significant margin. \\
While the list of presented optimization approaches is not exhaustive or complete, as new or more advanced methods are constantly being developed in this field, this thesis does in fact contain an overview of information and elaboration on key avenues. Chapters 3 through 6 cover multiple angles such as GPU versus CPU performance gains, pipeline speedups and varying hardware architectures and their intricacies. 
The implemented optimizations, while promising, did not all pan out as expected. Stencil Masking and Multiview Rendering show clear and tangible improvements in frametimes and were considered a success. Superfrustum Culling provided a tradeoff to alleviate stress and provide headroom on the CPU in exchange for higher GPU workloads and required fitting circumstances to pay off in a target scenario. Finally, Monoscopic Far-Field Rendering was the most interesting of the concepts presented, but in the practical implementation delivered incorrect and disappointing results. \\
In the end, valuable insight for deployment of these four optimizations was gained and even \gls{MFFR} still shows promise given additional iteration and care to iron out the observed issues. It is my hope that the presented approaches and demonstrated results are of similar value to other efforts in the field. After all, every millisecond shaved off is precious in real-time graphics.
