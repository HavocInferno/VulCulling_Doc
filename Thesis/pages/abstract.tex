%TODO: Abstract, check again for correctness
Virtual reality (VR) and modern low-level graphics APIs, such as Vulkan, are hot topics in the field of high performance real-time graphics. Especially enterprise VR applications show the need for fast and highly optimized rendering of complex industrial scenes with very high object counts. However, solutions often need to be custom-tailored and the use of middleware is not always an option. Optimizing a Vulkan graphics renderer for high performance virtual reality applications is a significant task. This thesis will research and present a number of suitable optimization approaches. The goals are to integrate them into an existing renderer intended for enterprise usage, benchmark the respective performance impact in detail and evaluate those results. This thesis will include all research and development documentation of the project, an explanation of successes and failures during the project and finally an outlook on how the findings may be used further.
