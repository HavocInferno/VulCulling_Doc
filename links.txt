VULKAN DETAILS

06 - Cull and LOD
Purely GPU based frustum visibility culling and level-of-detail system. A compute shader is used to modify draw commands stored in an indirect draw commands buffer to toggle model visibility and select it's level-of-detail based on camera distance, no calculations have to be done on and synced with the CPU.

04 - Occlusion queries
Using query pool objects to get number of passed samples for rendered primitives got determining on-screen visibility.
